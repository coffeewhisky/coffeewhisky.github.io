# Hello, fellow readers!

<img src="/images/me.jpg" alt="Abigail Jones">

I’m a bookish sprite indeed, with eclectic taste in literature and devouring book after book. I hope at worst to entertain you with reviews of books past and current; at best help you decide which book simply *has* to jump the queue to the top of your TBR pile.

My *modus operandi* is flitting between classics that have been sat on my list for years, gathering dust, and shiny new novels just out. I chop and change between genres a lot, though my favourites are literary, fantasy, magical, and anything dystopian: I’m a sucker for anything out of the ordinary. Spanish and Catalan fiction are also possibilities on this blog, as I try to keep my brain sharp and open to new worlds in different languages. Don’t worry, though, I’ll be writing in English!

To give you an idea, some of the books that have made a lasting impression on me are:

- The Book Thief – Markus Zusak
- The Snow Child – Eowyn Ivey
- Fahrenheit 451 – Ray Bradbury
- The Handmaid’s Tale – Margaret Atwood
- Jo Confesso – Jaume Cabré
- The Humans – Matt Haig
- The Hunger Games – Suzanne Collins
- and anything by Neil Gaiman or Terry Pratchett!
