> In that world, you disintegrate. Your body, your emotions, your perceptions and your thoughts are all separated into different components, like pages of a book that’s been ripped apart. There is a fish there, a silver fish, but that’s it. Everything else is just pitch-black.

Jia Jia takes her first steps towards real independence when her husband is found dead in the bathtub. She takes us from bustling modern-day Beijing to the quiet mountains in Tibet in search of the meaning of the crude fish-man drawing left by her husband that day, all the while delving deeper into her past.

As a character, she is rather like a pendulum: she’ll be open one moment then distant the next. It’s a trait that other characters in the book find tricky to deal with too, as Leo the bartender finds out – he spends the night at Jia Jia’s place then is emotionally pushed away in the morning, as if ‘out of place’. After he accuses her of not allowing him to get to know her, she replies: ‘How can you really know someone?…Even if I take my heart out, dissect it into pieces, and explain each piece in intricate detail to you – in the end, I would still have to stuff the whole damn thing back into my own chest.’ Perhaps this is the best reflection on feeling isolated in a rush and shove modern city lifestyle: keeping people at a distance is a strategy of self-defence. That said, she cautiously abandons her crafted politeness of a high-profile businessman’s wife and tests out her newfound liberty, no longer does she have to rein in her natural merriment and artistic talent.

Art is another way we can observe Jia Jia’s journey. Her career was stifled by her husband who disapproved of her painting, and it is her rekindling of her creative passion that is key to aiding her self-discovery. Her attempts at painting the fish-man are almost obsessive at times – she often painted when ‘she found it difficult to relate to a piece of artwork’ – yet it is telling that she can never achieve the correct image of the head. Is this indicative of the standard of perfectionism she feels she must live up to or is there a deeper significance?

Yu’s prose is crisp, plain, which might give off the impression that it’s boring. It isn’t. Despite the occasional clumsy sentence, there is an ethereal beauty in its simplicity, and its detachment, unexpected metaphors and an unpredictable plot (yet staying within the boundaries of the plausible). Two of the similes that particularly caught my eye were the description of Xiao Fang’s lips – ‘Her deep red lipstick made her aging lips look like dried cranberries’ – and Ren Qi’s palm being ‘rough like ginger.’

A few themes I found extremely intriguing are only skated over. One example is different generational opinions on marriage and divorce, which we get a glimpse of when Jia Jia meets Leo’s parents but is then left aside. However, perhaps the reason they are not further explored is because they have no real relevance to the plot or it would impose too much realism on a story that is such a delightful mix of real and surreal.

As alluded to in the primary quotation, Jia Jia experiences a world of blackness, cold and wet. The first instance occurs when she is in bed, crying silently, then wakes up; she ‘stepped onto what used to be the floor, falling into a sudden wet chill that was surely cold water.’ She sees a silver fish, a young one, but she turns away and swims towards a light. It’s a confusing moment, at first, but once you realise this is magical surrealism in action, you find yourself going with the flow.

I’d highly recommend this book, particularly to those looking to get a taste of Beijing life and anyone interested in the story of a young woman rediscovering herself.
