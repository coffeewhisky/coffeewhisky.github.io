> I want to say things but I don’t know how to order the words. Sentences slither around my brain. Scattered words. Scatterbrained. Scatter sentences. Scattered semantics. Scattered seeds. Scatter my brains.

This is a tricky one.

The narrative begins after the rape and assault of a college student, whose parents seem to be quite self-absorbed and going off to have sex and leaving her with the new baby.

Its stream of consciousness technique often works to the story’s advantage as we see Peach’s jumbled thoughts and visceral feelings in an unfamiliar world she has to re-navigate. So sometimes it’s unclear what’s ‘real’ and what Peach sees in that moment. For example, when she and her boyfriend are in a café, she is shocked to see ‘a large looming sausage pressed against the glass.’ Then: ‘He is gone but there is a seven-foot grease streak left on the glass and I can’t believe no one else saw.’ I thought that was well written, as it brought the sense of fear to the foreground, and the trauma that Peach is still experiencing.

It also plays on the trope that there are men who see women as mere pieces of meat – Glass turns this on its head and portrays the rapist as a disgusting greasy piece of meat, as well as being represented by the phallic symbol of the sausage. Language and imagery here are made use of in a ludic way, making the novel strangely and rhythmically readable.

Occasionally, however, the word association within and between sentences comes across as too try-hard, bringing me to my next point.

The novella seems to want to shock merely for the sake of shocking and there are events that narratively don’t make sense to me (why would a vegetarian eat a sausage made of human flesh at a BBQ just because she’s handed a hotdog and people are looking at her?). Its ending feels problematic too, as Peach simply disintegrates like the piece of fruit she is named after. Was this inevitable from the beginning? Was she always going to ‘spoil’? Or perhaps the peach-pit that is left could be a symbol of regrowth and hope. At least there is room for interpretation.
