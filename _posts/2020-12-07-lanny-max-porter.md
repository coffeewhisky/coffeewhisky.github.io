> Dead Papa Toothwort lies underneath a nineteenth-century vicar’s wife and fiddles with the roots of a yew in her pelvis. He loves the graveyard. He listens…

With a daring structure of voices and a range of characters from a small village just outside London, Porter brings to life the relationship between the inhabitants, the landscape, and an ancient pagan spirit newly reawakened.

Dead Papa Toothwort is an intriguing, malevolent character based on the Green Man of British folklore. He is a personification of rebirth, of the trees, the environment, a topic which is touched on from the beginning: he ‘wakes from his standing nap an acre wide and…cuts himself a mouth with a rusted ring pull…, coughs up a plastic pot and a petrified condom’ and other miscellaneous rubbish. His name refers to a plant which is parasitic in nature, hinting at an ominous need for the land and the villagers. The ‘tree demon’ takes a particular interest in Lanny, a young boy recently moved with his parents to the area.

Lanny is enchanting, almost faery-like, with his boundless imagination and magical way of seeing the world. He is a boy of nature, building dens and ‘singing, stinking of pine tree and other nice things’, a ‘free-range verge-clambering son’. In some ways, though, this blithe spirit is conspicuously absent, as he is never given his own heading – we are only permitted to see him through the eyes of the adults around him – compounding his sense of otherworldly disposition.

A special relationship develops between Lanny and a local artist, Mad Pete, another ‘outsider’. They often tramp into the woods together to sketch. When Lanny disappears, however, suspicion arises and rumour begins to infect the small community.

One of the book’s most striking aspects is the layout. In some ways, it is similar to his debut novel (Grief is the Thing with Feathers) with divisions and headings for the characters of those speaking, or whose thoughts we are reading. However, when the village gossip is reported, the snatches of conversation are printed separately in italics, some in standard lines and others in sing-song waves like rolling hills. At first they appear rather gentle, representing the idle chit-chat folk partake in; as the tension increases, and we see some of the darker fears and intolerant opinions seep through the villagers’ conversations, the lines start to cross over each other to create a more muddled, aggressive appearance.

It is poetry in prose form, from playing with sounds to feeling the rhythm and repetition of words and snippets of phrases.

The horror we feel in reality for a missing child is captured and translated to the page very adeptly. Lanny is a book that I could not put down, and I seldom use that phrase. Original, emotionally sensitive, whimsical and dark, this book will even appeal to those not usually interested in the supernatural as an alternative view of events can be interpreted.
